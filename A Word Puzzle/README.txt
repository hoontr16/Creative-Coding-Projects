Files included:

generatorOnly.ipynb: the main product/puzzle generator.
four word_puzzle.ipynb files: my collective work on this project (not including my handwritten scrawlings). No docstrings or in-code documentation to speak of, plenty of duplicate code. Very messy. View at your own risk.
cmuDict.txt: the version of the CMU-PD used throughout this work. careful opening it directly, it's quite large.
firstPoem.txt: an example poem generated from my code. uncomment the last cell of generatorOnly to create similar files
two .png files: images used in one of the word_puzzle files to demonstrate an issue I encountered.
sea_rose.txt: "Sea Rose" by H.D., used as an input text in the final product.
dracula_frankenstein.txt: technically used in the first word_puzzle file, but not processed in any meaningful way. I wanted to have the code learn pronunciations from a base text, and planned to use this. Included to prevent an error when running that old file.
